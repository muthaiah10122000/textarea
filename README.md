# textarea

This project is a simple textarea-based web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of the project is to help beginners understand how user input works and how JavaScript can interact with form elements.

The application contains a textarea where users can type or paste text. As the user types, JavaScript dynamically processes the input to provide useful feedback such as character count, word count, or live text preview. This helps demonstrate real-time DOM manipulation and event handling.

HTML is used to create the basic structure of the page, including the textarea and labels. CSS is applied to make the interface clean, readable, and user-friendly, with proper spacing and simple styling. JavaScript handles the logic, listening to user input events and updating the output instantly.

This project is ideal for beginners who want hands-on experience with:

Form elements like textarea

JavaScript events (input, keyup)

DOM manipulation

Basic styling with CSS

Overall, this project serves as a foundation for more advanced form-based applications such as feedback forms, comment sections, and text editors.
